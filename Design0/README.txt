HOW TO RUN: 

Unzip this folder, and import this Unity Project into Unity Hub. It should run from there, 
as these are my raw files.

Unity 3d Target Practice - Software Engineering, James Daly

Controls: Jump (spacebar), Walk (WASD), Look (Mouse), Sprint (shift key), Fire (left click)

My program is a small shooting range in which several red-tinted, geometrically 
simple objects are suspended in the air for the player to shoot. The objects
each have their own health and will 'die' after being reduced to 0 HP from being clicked on.
The player controls a capsule with full movement and look capabilities, all functioning perfectly.
The gun in the capsule's hand shoots using RayCasting and its model is from the Unity Store. The RayCasting is invisible and registers hits. 
It also has a muzzle flash effect on click with a custom texture applied. The muzzle effect was 
difficult to manipulate and kind of just appears around the gun rather than coming from inside it.

There is a fighter jet that flies away from you and makes noise, and a car that has lights on. 
These are prefabs from the Unity 3d store that I threw in so that I had more features 
in my program. Just for fun :)

The High Score and Current Score counters are both in the game and both have scripts running but they do not work properly.
I had a ton of problems getting file reads to work. 

I used some tree assets and some skins from the Store as well to spruce things up a bit. It's not pretty,
but I was more focused on getting as much of the functionality done as I could. I really struggled at first 
with the tutorials I was using, and had to scrap my first project because I caused so many errors. This final submission
is my 2nd draft of the program.

The tutorial I primarily followed to learn how to make this game are by this Youtuber:
